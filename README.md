# Mental-health-survey-EDA
This EDA project aims to analyse and detect possible insights/Recommendation from mental health survey that can be used to drive important decisions which could lead to a successful policy implementation regarding mental health of an employee. Detecting possible Stigma causing treatment reluctance is important since reluctance to mental health treatment can cause an organization work force to decline.
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.
